# Live-Class-Monitoring-System---Face-emotion-Recognition

## <b> Introduction </b>

The Indian education landscape has been undergoing rapid changes for the past 10 years owing to
the advancement of web-based learning services, specifically, eLearning platforms.

Global E-learning is estimated to witness an 8X over the next 5 years to reach USD 2B in 2021. India
is expected to grow with a CAGR of 44% crossing the 10M users mark in 2021. Although the market
is growing on a rapid scale, there are major challenges associated with digital learning when
compared with brick and mortar classrooms. One of many challenges is how to ensure quality
learning for students. Digital platforms might overpower physical classrooms in terms of content
quality but when it comes to understanding whether students are able to grasp the content in a live
class scenario is yet an open-end challenge.


In a physical classroom during a lecturing teacher can see the faces and assess the emotion of the
class and tune their lecture accordingly, whether he is going fast or slow. He can identify students who
need special attention. Digital classrooms are conducted via video telephony software program (exZoom) where it’s not possible for medium scale class (25-50) to see all students and access the
mood. Because of this drawback, students are not focusing on content due to lack of surveillance.
While digital platforms have limitations in terms of physical surveillance but it comes with the power of
data and machines which can work for you. It provides data in the form of video, audio, and texts
which can be analysed using deep learning algorithms. Deep learning backed system not only solves
the surveillance issue, but it also removes the human bias from the system, and all information is no
longer in the teacher’s brain rather translated in numbers that can be analysed and tracked.

## Problem Statement

We will solve the above-mentioned challenge by applying deep learning algorithms to live video data.
The solution to this problem is by recognizing facial emotions.

Facial Emotion Recognition (commonly known as FER) is one of the most researched field of computer vision till date and is still in continuous evaluation and improvement. The idea is, can we detect the emotion a person is having by his/her facial expressions? Of-course as a human we can very easily do that and in-fact we do this thousands of times every day. But can we make our so called dumb-machines intelligent enough so they can also achieve human level performance on these emotion recognizing task? See, because we humans have emotions that’s why we are easily able to detect other’s emotions but that’s not the case with machines.

The advancements in the field of computer vision are skyrocketing, these tasks are no more that difficult, at-least we are able to achieve good performance with very less amount of efforts. We will see how that can be done with some lines of python code.
